       "\" let's get started with our linear algebra review in this video i want to tell you what are matrices and what are vectors a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers written between square brackets so for example here is a matrix i'm going to write a left square bracket and then write in a bunch of numbers and you know these could be features for a machine learning problem or it could be data from somewhere else but for example the specific values don't matter and then i'm gonna close it with another right bracket on the right so that's one matrix and you know here's another example of a matrix mr right one two three four five six so matrix is just another way for saying is a 2d or two dimensional array and the other piece of analogy we need is that the dimensional matrix is going to be written as the number of rows times the number of columns in the matrix so concretely this example on the left this has one two three four rows and it has two columns and so this example on the left i'm going to say this is a four by two matrix okay because it's number of rows by number of columns so four rows two columns this one on the right this matrix has two rows so that's the first row that's the second row and it has three columns right that's the first column that's the second column that's the third column so this second matrix we say it is a two by three matrix so we say that the dimension of this matrix is two by three and sometimes you also see this written out as uh in the case of the left you see this written out as our four by two or concretely what people sometimes say is that this matrix is an element of the set r four by two so this this thing here this just means a set of all matrices that are of dimension four by two and this thing on the right sometimes it's written out as a matrix that's an r two by three so if you ever see excuse me two by three so if you ever see something like this you know alpha by two or r two by three people are just referring to matrices of a specific dimension next let's talk about how to refer to specific elements of the matrix and by matrix elements i love the matrix i just mean the entries or the numbers inside the matrix so in the standard notation if a is this matrix here then a substring i j is going to refer to the i comma j entry meaning the entry in the matrix is in the i've row and j column so for example a11 is we're going to refer to the entry in the first row and the first column so that's the first row in the first column and so you know a11 is going to be equal to 1402 another example a12 is going to refer to the entry in the first row and the second column and so a12 is going to be equal to 191 just a couple more quick examples let's see a oh let's say a32 is going to refer to the entry in the third row and the second column right because that's three two so that's equal to one four three seven and finally a four one is going to refer to you know this one right fourth row first column is equal to one four seven and if hopefully you won't but if you were to write say what is a four three well that refers to the fourth row and the third column but you know this matrix has no third column so this is undefined you know or you can think of this as an error so there's no such element as a a43 so you know shouldn't be referring to a43 so the matrix gives you a way of letting you quickly organize index and access lots of data and in case i seem to be tossing up a lot of concepts a lot of new notation very rapidly you don't need to memorize all this but on the course website where we have posted the lecture notes we also have all of these definitions written down so you can always refer back you know either to these slides post on the course website or to the lecture notes if you forget like well a41 is that which row which column is that don't worry about memorizing everything now you can always refer back to the written materials on the course website use that as a reference so that's what the matrix is next let's talk about what is a vector a vector turns out to be a special case of a matrix a vector is a matrix that has only one column so if you have an n by one matrix then that's a remember right n is the number of rows and one here is number of columns so so a matrix with just one column is what we call a vector so here's an example of a vector right with uh i guess i have n equals four elements here so we also called this thing another term for this is that this is a four dimensional vector just means that this is a vector with four elements with four numbers in it and just as you know earlier for matrices you saw this notation that r 3 by 2 is referred to 3 by 2 matrices right for this vector we're going to refer this to to this as a vector in the set's r4 so this r4 again just means the set of all four dimensional vectors next let's talk about how to refer to elements of the vector we're going to use the notation y i to refer to the element of the vector y so why is this vector y subscript i is the i element so y one is the first element is equal to 460 you know y2 is equal to the second element right 232 that's the first there's a second y3 is equal to 315 and so on and only y1 through y4 are defined because this is a four-dimensional vector also it turns out that there are actually two conventions for how to index into a vector and here they are sometimes people will use one index and sometimes zero index vectors so this example on the left is a one index vector where the elements we write as y one y two y three y four and this example on the right is an example of a zero index vector where we start the indexing of the elements from zero so the elements go from y zero up to y three and this is a little bit like the arrays of some programming languages right where the arrays can either be indexed starting from one so the first element of an array sometimes say y1 that's kind of c plus notation i guess and sometimes you know it's zero zero index depending on what programming language you use so it turns out that in most of math the one index version is more common but for a lot of machine learning applications zero index vectors gives us a more convenient notation so what you should usually do is uh unless otherwise specified you should assume that we're using one index vectors in fact throughout the rest of these videos on linear algebra review i will be using one index vectors but just be aware that when we talk about machine learning applications sometimes you know i'll explicitly say when we need to switch to when we need to use zero index vectors as well finally by convention usually when writing matrices and vectors most people will use uppercase to refer to matrices so we use capital matrix capital letters like a b c you know x to refer to matrices and usually we'll use lowercase like a b x y to refer to either numbers just real numbers or scalars or two vectors but this isn't always true but this is the more common notation where we use the lowercase y to refer to vector and we usually use uppercase to refer to a matrix so you now know what are matrices and vectors next we'll talk about some of the things you can do with them \""

So the first is Alan Professor Adelman, Alan Adelman, the creator of Julia, who had the idea for this event, but it's out of the country now, out of the conference. So what I'm hoping to do now is to introduce him by Zoom and so hopefully we'll come on the screen for a few minutes. Then I'll talk about linear algebra. I hope that's okay for most of the hour. And then at the end of the hour, one of my PhD students and the Pablo Grinfeld and then the chair of the math department, Michel Gomez will end the class. So it's a apologies to the 1806 class who wants preparation for the final exam, but I'll do some of that in the middle. So first of all, if the system is ready to send Alan's message, they could go ahead. Today is a special moment in MIT history. Oh good. It is fitting that gathered together today are young students completing their first in the algebra class, together with those who have been inspired by Gil Strang for perhaps over half a century. Gil, you recognize in everyone the thirst for knowledge, you always bring out the best in everybody, and you do so with dignity and humility. I have watched Gil encourage everybody, no matter who. Whether a student was struggling or at the top of the class, Gil always knew just what to say. Whether you were a colleague, right next door, or a stranger that landed in the hallways, one feels that Gil is your old or new best friend. So what makes Gil's lecture so very special? I think we might all agree that words fall short. And yet we all know how wonderful they are. Gil was a YouTube star even before there was such a thing as YouTube. I love his words, his tone, his pace, and the very way that the answer seems like a surprise, when of course we all know he rigged it from the beginning. I'd like to see something particularly wonderful about Gil's textbooks. The simple examples lead to deep understanding. The good abstractions from the deeper classes are in Gil's text, but yet they are made accessible the Gil Strang way. You can still find vector spaces, subspaces, dimensions, the Peron for Beanie's Theorem, and linear transformations. All those goodies from pure linear algebra are not lost, just made more relevant. I love watching how he weaves those deeper ideas into the flow of the class. Gil sneaks in the real spirit of this beautiful mathematical subject, and it's for everybody. Speaking of the textbooks, I have a personal story to share. Some years ago, Gil was going out of town and had two tickets to an event he didn't want to go to waste. He gave us the instructions on how to unlock his home, but still my wife, eight months pregnant at the time, felt like the Wellesley Police would surely arrest us for breaking an entering. But then we saw an amazing sight. Stacks and stacks of Gil's linear algebra text, Florida's ceiling, and somehow we felt comforted that we were in a place that we belonged. Gil, we all love your books, your videos, your lectures. You are our own model and friends. So congratulations on so many fine class lectures, and not wishing to see today as final, I officially invite you to guess lecture in any of my classes or seminars anytime you might wish to. Today is a milestone, and I am honored to share this moment with you. Okay. Thank you. Wow. Well, thank you. Does that mean I have to give another lecture from his invitation? This is the final one. And so let me say a little about first, the most important thing I have to say, the most important is to thank Andrew Horning, who has co-taught this course, done far more than I have made it happen. Got us to this point. He's not feeling great today. He did so much. So I'm speaking to him and for him to thank you for coming and to thank him for all he's done. So he really made it possible to teach this happy but large class. So thank you, Andrew. So then I'm going to, I feel a little responsible to do some linear algebra and part of my family is here. So I'm taking this chance after all these years to teach them some linear algebra. And you might be interested to know, I don't know if you are, how many years it's been. So I'll do that over here and then maybe erase it because it's like a lot. So on the faculty, it's 61 years now today. Yeah. And then prior to that I was an instructor for two years. You see, I remember all these and then I was an MIT student before this room existed but I was a math major. There were about eight math majors then and now there's hundreds. It's just been fantastic. So that was three years. So that's 66. And you too will be happy to know that it's 66 out of my 88 years. So what a nice fraction. So three quarters of my life at MIT. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I'm going to begin by solving some linear equations. Those are linear, I'm now speaking to family and, but speaking to you all, just only the class certainly will know this. So that's three equations and there are three unknowns x, y, and z and the goal is to find those three numbers x, y, and z. So this is maybe the most standard problem in linear algebra and equations and unknowns in this example n equals three. So how do we proceed? How do we find x, y, and z? Well, the idea comes thousands of years ago in China and the keyword is elimination. We don't have any zeros there. It's zeros that make calculations easier. And so let me show you how this steps. For those who know it well. So the first equation I won't change, 2x plus 3y plus 4z equal 19. What I want to get is some zeros here. I want the second equation to start with zero. So how do I do, where I now have a four, I want a zero. So I have that equation set. And I subtract two times that equation from this one. I choose that number two. So the two times two x will be 4x. And when I subtract, I'll have a zero. So I multiply that by two. So two times three y is six y leaving five y. And two times four z is eight z from 14 leaving six z. And two times 19 is 38 from 55 leaving 17. So we've got an easier equation now. And I'll do the same for the third equation. This time, I have a two x there and a two x there. So I just want to subtract that equation from this one to make this one zero x plus 3y taken away from 8y leaves 5y. And four z from 17 z is 13z and 19 from 50 is 31. So we've taken the first step. We've got zeros in the first column below the pivot, the number that we used to get those zeros. OK. So I'm part way along. And then the idea is to continue. And so I now look at the second and third equations. I have two equations here. And they just involve y and z. So I'm making progress. I had three equations with three unknowns. Now I have two equations with two unknowns and let's go to one equation with one unknown. So I want to get a zero there. So that I'll just have z's and a right hand side. So if I subtract everybody's seeing is sort of getting in the swim. If I subtract that equation from this one, it'll be zero x, zero y. And what is it? 7z equal 17 from 31 is 14. OK. So now I have an equation for z alone. An equation for y and z together. And the starting equation for x, y and z all together. So what's next? Go backwards. So this equation for z, then back to this one for y, and then back to this one for x. So this is called elimination. And it was invented in China three or 4,000 years ago. So I'm sorry. This is a little bit old mathematics. But it's the basic step that simplifies. And then I'll show you a little more. So let's go backwards. Maybe you could all do it as I do it. If we solve that equation for z, I get z equal to 2, right? Divide by 7. And now if z is 2, then 13z here is 26. So I have 5y and 26 and 31. Well, if I subtract the 26 from the 31, I'm moving the 26 over with 31, because it's just a number. So I subtracting this 26 leaves me 5. So I have 5y equal 5. So 5y equal 5 is what that equation has become. That's told me y is 1. And finally, I come back to the top equation. Because I now know y and z. So z is 2. That's 8. If y is 1, that's 3. So I have 3 and 8 and 19 there. So I should be able to figure out x. Do you see what x is? Yeah, let me. This is for the class now. I got you this far by elimination. So I have this equation to solve for x. And then I've got the answer. I've got all of x, y, and z. So what do I have? 4z is 8. 3y is 3. And 2x is what? 8, 2x is 8. Thanks. Professors need help, especially at this point. 2x is 8. So x is 4. Well done. 100% a for the whole class. You're right. OK. All right. Well, OK. So let me just say that if we were doing this on the computer, we wouldn't keep repeating all these letters x and y and z and all the plus signs and all the equal signs. I would write those equations or the original equations. I would write as, oh, dear, that's out of sight. So I would write the original equations as 2, 3, and 4, 4, 11, and 14, 2, 8, and 17. So there's the matrix. The matrix of coefficients, the matrix of the right-hand side, of the numbers on the right-hand side. And they multiply if we define multiplication suitably, there's the x, y, z, unknown. So this is the matrix. This is the unknown to find. This is the part to find. And then the right-hand side is 1955-50. OK. So that's the way you would write the equations in a matrix form. So I've introduced you to the idea of a matrix. This happens to be a square matrix, three rows and three columns. And that's because I have three equations up there. So all the operations that I did would be done just directly on the matrix, subtract two of this row away from this, subtract that row away from that, and so on. So this is the short, you could say, the shorthand, the idea of matrix multiplication. You begin to get an idea of how matrices multiply when you realize that this first equation comes from this along with that. So the first equation comes from the first row times the unknowns equaling the first number 19. So yeah. So it would simplify to this. So this, I'll just repeat again. So 2, 3, 4, we didn't change. This changed to 2, 5, 6. And this ultimately changed to 0, 0, 7. I think 6 from 13, 6 from 13 left 7. So the reduced equation was this one. We had a 14 here. We had a 17 here, and we had a 19 here. So this is the original problem. This is the simplified problem. You see, we produced a triangular matrix. And the unknowns are still saying, so we've written the using matrix notations so that we didn't have to keep writing pluses and so on. Yeah. So this is exactly the same as that. And now how do we solve it? Just thinking again, how solve it? We came from top to bottom as we went here. And now to find the answer, we went bottom to top. We found z equal to 2. By the time we knew z, then the next equation told us y was 1, and finally x was 4. So this led to the answer, 4, 1, 2. OK. Good. So that was 3 equations and 3 unknowns. And linear algebra is maybe the most common problem in numerical computation is solving a system of equations. And again, this equation had the same number of equations 3 as unknowns 3. So we expect one solution, not always the case, but here it worked. OK. So that's less than 1. Let me do something similar for a different problem. It won't be a square matrix this time. The matrix will be rectangular. So we may have many solutions. We may have no solutions, all depending on what the numbers are. So let me just write down. So this is my second and last example for the guess and also for 1806. OK. So now I'm going to write down the matrix A in the next problem. New problem. Now what's different about this problem is there are still going to be three equations, but there will be four unknowns. So now I'm that extra unknown. Well, I don't even necessarily have to give the letters for it. I'm going to use this shorthand. So now I have a matrix A. Matrix C's are always A. There's not much imagination required. 11 and 37, I think. 37, 37. I think maybe that's 17. Sorry. Well, see. 37 and 57. And 4, 9, 48 and 74. OK. So again, I'm using this matrix shorthand. So I'm not writing the equations out, but I could this way. So there would be three equations again. And I need three right-hand sides. Oh, I'm going to take the right-hand sides to be 0. So all I need is that matrix. So I'm calling this matrix again A. And I want to multiply it by maybe a better number these x1, x2, x3, x4. So that's a shorthand for that would be x, a vector. And on the right-hand side, I'm going to have zeros. A x equal to 0 vector. You see that I'm moving you toward matrix vector notation and beginning to think more generally. So now we have a vector that's in four-dimensional space. So we have to get used to that. All it means is that there are four components to our vector. We could try to visualize four-dimensional space, but we don't have to. This is, at this point, we're doing algebra, not geometry. And we can just go ahead. So what do you think? Are there solutions to this equation? To these three equations, I should say. Are there any, can you think of any x1, x2, x3, x4 that solves four equations? Yes, I think you can. So what's one solution that's sure to be here? All zeros. Yeah. Yeah. So this equation stands for x1 plus 2x2 plus 11x3 plus 17x4 equals 0, something else equals 0, something else equals 0. So I have three equations and four unknowns. Yes, so this is different. I have m equal three equations, n equal four unknowns, and the right-hand side is all zeros. So I do have solutions. The question is, do I have any non-zero solutions? Any solutions that are not zero? So how are we going to discover the solutions? And do we think in advance, let's just make a guess before I get to use these numbers? Do we think that there are solutions other than all zeros? Everybody sees that if you visualizing this also in the form of this, this is saying again that x1 plus 2x2 plus 11x3 plus 17x4 equals 0. And of course, all zeros will be a solution. But we have only three equations and we have four unknowns. So what do we know about that? There will be a solution there. And especially with zeros on the right side. So we have m equals three. So one solution is x equal y equals the equals 0. If all these multiply 0, oh, sorry, x, I have new names for them because now I've got four. I kind of ran out of letters. So it's x1 equals x2 equals x3 equals x4 equals 0. But we look for more. Three equations, four unknowns. We've got freedom here. We can expect to find some non-zero x's. And the question is how many? And the question is, and we can only answer that by simplifying the matrix. Just as we did there, we'll simplify this by subtracting equations from other equations. So let me start on that process. So one solution, but I'm looking for more solutions. OK. So everybody in 1806, now I'll speak to you guys first. So you know that we'll do elimination again. That elimination process will produce zeros here. And we'll get to see what's going on. So right now we have three equations, four unknowns. So we would sort of expect maybe one family of solutions because we've got an extra unknown. But you can't tell until you get into the numbers. OK. So now again, what does elimination mean? Elimination is take combinations of the columns that produce some zeros. And I see one combination of the column that produces one combinations of the rows, I should have said. Combinations of the rows that produce some zeros. And I see one combination right away. Well, I built it in there. So not surprising. I can see it. But can you see it that will produce a lot of zeros? I think that that row and that row, there's a connection between them. And you see it. You see what's special about the three rows of the matrix. Those rows have four components. So they're popping off somewhere in four dimensional space. But they're a bit special. And what special there is somebody could say? Look at rows one, two, and three there. Do you see anything connected there? The first two rows add to the third row. Row one plus row two is row three. So row three is necessary. It's I can subtract row one from row two, row three, and row two from row three. And what will I then get? I'll save myself writing. What will I get if I subtract rows one and two from row three? All zeros, yes. So I'm in a different situation here. I still have a. You all saw that the numbers there were just, it was the 74. This was the 48. This was the 9, and that was the 4. And so now when I subtract the first equation and the second equation from the third, I've got zero equals zero, which that's perfect. No problem. Automatically it's going to give the zero on the right hand side. So really now I have two equations in four unknowns. Two equations in four unknowns. So I'm looking expecting maybe four minus two would be two solutions. I'm expecting two non-zero solutions. OK. So how do I get there? I think I get more zeros in the matrix. OK. So again, we're ready to work on the problem, the given problem by subtracting suitable multiples of a row from another row, because I'm subtracting an equation from an equation. So it leaves me with a correct equation. OK. Let me do that. So let me subtract what I would like to get. Now you could help me. I'd like to get a zero in that position, just the way I did in the first problem. So how shall I get a zero where I have a three? I'll subtract three times row one from row two. So I'll keep row one, and I won't keep writing all the zeros and the x's. We understand that. It's only the numbers here that matter. So I have one, two, 11, and 17. And I'm subtracting three times that. So three ones that made the zero that I want. Three, two, is six, taken away from seven is a one. Three, 11 is 33. Take away from 37, this leaves four. And three, 17 is 51, leaves six. Do you agree with that? And this row of all zeros is still here. OK? Good. Progress. What else can I do? So this is elimination. And now I'm going to, because I'm dealing with a more general problem, I'm going to allow elimination upwards. I want to subtract a multiple of equation two from equation one and make it still simpler. So my zero equals zero is no problem. This one I'm keeping now, because it has that zero that I paid for with some computing. But now, what do I want to do? I want to subtract a multiple of this from the top equation. So I'm working upwards this time. Well, when I subtract this, that'll still leave the one. But I would like to get a zero there. I want to get zeros, because then I can write out this solution easily. So what do I do? What do I multiply row two by? Everybody hears with me. I want to multiply row two by some number and subtract from row one and get that zero. So what do I multiply row two by? Two. Thank you. Everybody in this class is going to have an A. I'm sorry to think that this class is recorded, because I didn't really mean it. I'll just say you all deserve an A. How's that? That's a nice news. Yes, at least based on so far today. But there's more questions on this final exam. So you have A so far. OK. So I want to subtract this from the row above to get that zero. What do I multiply this by? Two. Subtract from this. So two ones is two. And the subtraction gives a zero. Two fours is eight, leaving three. And two sixes is 12, leaving five. OK. So my equation is now my three equations. Well, this is a zero equals zero equation. My equations are x1 from the 1, no x2s, 3x3s, and 5x4s equally zero. The right side stayed zero because it was always zero. And the other equation here is no x1, 1x2, 4x3s. And 6x4s. So those equations are equivalent to the first ones. I just did subtraction of equation from equation. That's totally safe. And it's reversible. I could get from that back to that by doing adding back. So that's just as good, in fact, better than the original. We ought to be able to write down the solutions for this one. And let me count. What are we expecting? Let's get a little geometry in this. So I have, I'm in four-dimensional space. That's a challenge right away to visualize four-dimensional space. But I have an x1, x2, x3, x4. So my solution vector has four components. And so what are some solutions? Can you find what are all the solutions I'd like to know? And notice one point. There's zeroes on the right-hand side. So that tells me if I find one set of x's that works, then two times that set of x's will work. Five times that set of x's will work, because I'll have zero equals zero. And I can safely multiply by five. So I'm expecting two solutions, two separate solutions. And I'll write those maybe up above. x1, x2, x3, x4. Yeah, so give me two equations. And for these four unknowns, let me start out with x3 equal to a 1, and x4 equal to a 0. So I'm just sort of freely setting x3 and x4 as 1 and 0. And then I'll figure out, or you'll figure out what x1 and x2 have to be. So what's the answer then? If x3 is 1, and x4 is 0, what is x1? And this is obviously 0. So what is x1? That leads to x1 equal what's x1? Negative 3. Thank you. And what's x2? That will come from this equation. What will x2 be? Negative 4. So that's a solution. We've solved this original problem. I raised it. It was much worse at the beginning, but we found a solution. But again, we have four unknowns. And we have only two real equations, two independent equations. Because this third equation turned out to be a fraud, it was just a combination of 1 and 2. So we really have only two equations, four unknowns. So we'd expect two solutions, and I've found one of them. OK. So that's good. So let me find the other one. And then this problem is solved, and we can go on with it. So another solution, I want to find another x1, x2, x3, and x4. And tell me what it is. So this time, I'll start with 0 and 1 for these guys. I'll let that be 0 and that be 1. And then I'll use the equations to tell me x1 and x2, or you will. So now what is x1 from this equation? Minus 5, thanks. This is minus 5. And what is x2 from this equation? Negative? Negative 6. OK. We found two solutions, clearly independent, minus 3, minus 4, 1, 0. That's a vector in four dimensions. We're in four dimensions. This is, this is, linear algebra has no problem to go up in dimension. It stays linear. That's what keeps things simple. Then it goes up to any number of dimensions. And so these would be typical problems coming from some engineering system. Some, some, yeah. So we have two solutions. And that's somehow right. And any combination of those is a solution. So I have actually, if I combine one of this solution plus 6 of that solution, I'd have another solution. Because on the right side, I would just have still all 0s. OK. So that problem is solved. And as we expected, let's just review. So I have, I started with three rows and four columns. But the three rows were not independent. The three equations, a combination of the three equations gave me a 0. So I really had the rank of the matrix is 2. So this is a matrix with m equal 3 rows, n equal 4 columns. But the rank of the matrix, the rank of the matrix, is what? Now, everybody, if you don't know what the word rank is, let the 1806 team tell you, what's the rank of my matrix? 2. Oh, you do know. Yeah, OK. So it's rank is 2. So it's row rank is 2. Now, the most wonderful theorem in linear algebra. The most wonderful theorem, at least at the beginning of linear algebra, is that if I have two independent rows, and that's what I have, two independent rows. The third row was a combination, didn't count. So I had two independent rows, so the row rank is 2. And now look at the columns. So I had originally four columns. I still have four columns. I didn't mess with combination. How many independent columns do I have? How many? Yeah, look at this matrix. Look at this matrix, because nothing, these numbers didn't change. Look at that matrix. So that has one, two, three, four columns. But they're not independent. Some of those columns are combinations of other columns. So that's what the beginning of linear algebra is about, and what's the answer to the column rank. So the column rank is the number of independent columns. And what do I get for that? Two, thank you. That's the great first wonderful, not at all, clear fact. If I went back to the original matrix and said there are two independent rows, and then math told me that there were two independent columns. Well, I would believe it because it gets proved in 1806. But this is the great fact that the two, the number of independent rows matches the number of independent columns. OK. I think it's, I thought there'd be time for some more review of old finals. This could have been on a final. And let's see. Do you want to answer me one question? No, you don't. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's the right time to ask Pavel Grinfeld, who is one of my first early PhDs to say a few words. And then if Professor Gohmens is here, he's here. OK. So Pavel, thanks. Thank you. APPLAUSE This is the mic, right? So I wrote down some thoughts. So don't please, don't be worried. This is not a long speech. It's just a very large font. And so, and I just want to say, this is not in the speech. I was sitting over there and I was looking back most of the time at the sea of beautiful faces. And I was just thinking to myself, your faces are so beautiful, not only because you're so young and have such amazing hair, and not only because you're accomplished enough to be taking leading algebra so early in your college careers, but also because you're in Gilles presence. And when you're in Gilles presence, you're just in the better, more beautiful world. And I think that your faces are channeling that. So that's just what it's like, no one Gilles. And I think that's why I chose to pursue the same line of studies as Gilles. And it has Gilles presence in my life has informed so many of my decisions. So anyway, so that's just some thoughts that I had. Now I'll get to my speech. And first, I want to say congratulations, Gilles, on your retirement. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now you will finally have some time to concentrate on your research. Right. And we all owe you a debt of gratitude for everything you've done. But my life especially has been touched by you. So all I want to do is just share a few of my personal experiences. So if I think back to one of the most important days in my life, it was the day that I passed my qual. And it wasn't because I passed my qual. It's because when you said congratulations, and I said thank you, Professor Strang, you said I think that going forward, Gilles, is more appropriate. And in that moment, I felt like I've made it. And to this day, I look back on that day as the day that I've made it. That's just how much it means to me to be on the first name basis with you. And speaking of your name, I have to confess that I name drop your name all the time. So for example, if somebody asks me for a linear algebra textbook recommendation, I say well, I might be biased because he was my advisor. But I recommend Strang's book. And I understand it takes away from the recommendation a little bit. But that's just how proud I am to be your student. Now, this is very personal. I want to say a few words about your office. When I'm in your office, to me, it's like an oasis of peace. And I feel like the zero sum world is left at the door and that only good things can happen while I'm there. And I just still remember sitting in front of your desk and the stacks of papers and books. It looks like the late stages of the game, Jenga. And I feel like they might be about to fall, but I still feel like all is right with the world. And it's just one of the most comfortable places to be. And today, when I know that my son is outside playing soccer, and I hear the sound of shattering glass, I close my eyes. I take a deep breath and I go to my good place, which is your office. That's the safe place. That's the safe place in me. So you've been, Alan was saying something to that effect, but you've been a role model in all aspects of my life. You've taught me a lot of things. You've taught me how to give without thinking about taking. You taught me how to always find a positive way when you need to say something and how it's especially important to find a positive way to answer a question that wasn't necessarily asked in a positive way. You taught me a lot about always remembering about what matters. I remember I was lamenting to you how my videos, how other math videos on YouTube get thousands of times more views than my videos. And you said views, yes, but how many memories? And I just want to say that you guys are so lucky because you will remember this class and you will remember this experience and you will have these memories. And thanks for teaching me that it's the memories that count and not the views. And I never thought about views again after that conversation. Now, you also, what I really appreciate is that you're always forthcoming with advice when it's badly needed. And I'll just relate one story when you were over at our house for dinner and you learned that my kitchen had been under construction for a year and making there was slow progress. You looked me straight in the eye and said, Pavel, your family needs a kitchen. And a month later, my kitchen was completed and I needed to hear that. And this is the mildest of all examples when you recognize that I needed input from you and you gave it. So I'm thankful for that very much. And my wife thinks you too. I just have two more things to say. So a few years ago, you came to Drexel and gave a talk at the Math Colloquium. And you said, I'm about to use two words that I may have never used in the talk before. And those words were theorem and proof, which is quite remarkable for a mathematician. And I think we all appreciate how you keep things unsophisticated. Just look at this board. Clear, clear and simple. And for a guy who only talks about matrices, it's amazing that you are, as I see it, one of the most universal mathematicians. And you have taught us that a simple three by three matrix can give us scientific insight. And before you, matrix was a dirty word. And now I think we would all be proud to have a beautiful matrix with special properties at the center of any of our papers. And I think that mathematicians used to look down on linear algebra. But you were right all along about how important the subject is. And now I think Chad G.P.T. and the linear algebra behind it looks down on us. So you had it right. So we're all very excited to see what you'll accomplish in your retirement. But I'm sure that whatever it is, you will have remembered not just for your scientific accomplishments, but for human decency. And I might be biased because I was your student, but I think you're the best. So thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That was really great. Let me say a few quick rorns since it's almost the end of the year. So I'm Michel Gohmins, and I'm the head of the math department. And Gail Scarion at MIT has just been extraordinary. As he said, he has been for 16, 1 years on the faculty in mathematics. And that's actually more than any other faculty member in the history of the department. And possibly of the history of the math. And possibly even in the history of MIT, but I couldn't check that. And as he said, his affiliation with MIT has been even longer since he was a math majorant from 1952 to 1955 and a more instructor from 59 to 61. Mathematics, as you know, is everyone engineering and science. And in that spirit, Gail's mission has been to educate countless of students from everywhere on the planet in linear algebra, calculus, differential equations. And more generally applied mathematics and computational science. I say everyone on the planet. And in fact, at the beginning of this lecture, I was checking on YouTube. And I saw comments from people in Condistan, Turkey, Russia, Mongolia, Iran, Brazil, Thailand, India, South Korea, Nigeria, Germany, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, Philippines, Morocco, Greece, Italy, China, Taiwan, Brazil, Armenia, Indonesia, Croatia, Egypt, and even my own country of Belgium. His lectures are legendary. It's not a surprise that 450 students registered from 1806 for the last time he was teaching to get on with Andrew Owning. But students well beyond the walls of MIT have benefited from his classes. He was the first to put lectures on OCW and as it started. And as had his many courses on OCW attract about 5,000 daily visits, that's pretty significant. And his videos apparently have been seen by more than 14 million people. That's quite remarkable. And as part of his education, he has published over on 13 books if I got the number right, because it seems that every week there is almost a new one. His impact on mathematics has been, and especially on math education, has been mind-boggling. So I taught 1806 many years ago. And before teaching, I attended Guillaume's lectures just to see his way of teaching. And his pedagogical style is indeed really unique. I felt he's really good at making students think and feel like they discover the concepts by themselves. And if he seems sometimes lost in front of the black bond, I quickly realized it's just pretence. He knows exactly what he's talking about. And I should say also that as department head, I often meet alumni, MIT alumni, where they're math majors from other disciplines. And quite often, they say, oh, I have these memorable class at MIT. The name was Gil Strang. And then they say, oh, he must be retired by now decades ago. I say, no, no, he's still here. But finally, I'll be able to say, yes, he has retired now. I'm sorry to hear that. So I've been in this department for half of his tenure, and he has been an amazingly pleasant colleague. He is so humble. And so after 61 years, the institute will miss him and his teaching. But I think he fully disowns with time. And so please join me in congratulating Gil for his lifelong dedication to mathematics and its education and my MIT. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Oh. Thank you all. This is really an unforgettable day for me. Thank you. And thank you, Michelle. Good. Very good. So he believes I'm going to retire. I'm going to think about it. So thank you all. Thank you.空 can't see the classroom.\""
